A port of Michael Bayne's [React](https://github.com/threerings/react) Java library.

The Objective-C version was originally written by [Charlie Groves](https://github.com/groves) and [Tim Conkling](https://github.com/tconkling) for Three Rings Design, and was packaged with the Java version. It's resurrected here, with improvements!
